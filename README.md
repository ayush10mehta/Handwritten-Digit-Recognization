# Handwritten-Digit-Recognization

## The handwritten digit recognition is the ability of computers to recognize human handwritten digits. It is a hard task for the machine because handwritten digits are not perfect and can be made in many different ways.
## The handwritten digit recognition is the solution to this problem which uses the image of a digit and recognizes the digit present in the image.
## To perform handwritten digit recognition, some basic knowledge on neural network and image processing is needed.
